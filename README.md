## Attention-Processing

This is a very basic processing library for selecting a region of an input image and warping it to an output image of a different size. It's useful for computer vision applications where you want to manually 'focus' the 'attention' of a camera's input on a specific region within its view, and warp the resulting area to a rectangle, as if it were directly facing the camera.

### Dependencies
This library requires Greg Borenstein's [opencv-processing library](https://github.com/atduskgreg/opencv-processing).

### Usage
See the example for usage.
